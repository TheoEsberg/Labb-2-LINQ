# Labb-2-LINQ

This project is part of the [Avancerad.Net](https://qlok.notion.site/6-Avancerad-NET-d7035129aa1f46608d36dc8333dd1ecd) course and is designed to test my skills in C#, object-oriented programming, and the .NET Framework.

## Task Description
In this task, you will create a console application with a menu that tests the following methods:

* Retrieve all teachers who teach math
* Retrieve all students and their teachers
* Check if the subjects table contains "programming1" or not
* Edit a subject from "programming2" to "OOP"
* Update a student's record if their teacher is "Anas" to "Reidar"

You will also need to create four models - Teacher, Student, Course (e.g. "SUT22"), and Subject ("Avancerad.net") - and connect them with navigation properties.
